    - README.md
        - Installation
    - docs/README.md
      - Javadoc links
      - Installation
4. Create a tag for the preceding commit of the format `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (e.g. v1.2.3)
5. Create a merge request into main and merge when ready

# Versioning

- This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- What is considered breaking is generally up to the discretion of the developer, however there are
  a few exceptions:
  - If an element is marked with `@org.jetbrains.annotations.ApiStatus.Experimental`, it is free to
    be modified or removed without a major release
  - If an element has been marked with `@Deprecated(forRemoval = true)` for at least one minor 
    version, it may be removed without a major release
  - Source or binary incompatibilities are always considered breaking
  - If an element is marked with `@org.jetbrains.annotations.ApiStatus.NonExtendable`, new methods
    may be added to the class without a major release
